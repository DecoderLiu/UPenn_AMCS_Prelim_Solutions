# UPenn_AMCS_Prelim_Solutions

I am about to attend the prelim exam as an incoming PhD stuent. To make sure that I indeed put some effort to this exam, I am making this repository as a tracker that alerts me to do something every day.

Please find the copy of problems sheets on the website of Penn AMCS. Feel free to use my answer as one (maybe not so reliable) source of your reference.

Communiations of multiple solutions are warmly welcomed :)
